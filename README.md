# ROTI-map-forecast
Neural network for daily prediction of the ROTI map

### Abstract

ROTI (index of rate of total electron content (TEC) change) maps are constructed with the grid of 2° × 2° resolution as a function of the magnetic local time and corrected magnetic latitude. The ROTI maps allow to estimate the overall fluctuation activity and auroral oval evolutions, in general, the ROTI values are corresponded to the probability of the GPS signals phase fluctuations.

In this paper, the daily prediction of ROTI cards is implemented using machine learning methods.
