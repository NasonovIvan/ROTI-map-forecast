# ROTI-map-forecast
Neural network for daily prediction of the ROTI map

### Abstract

The International GNSS Service (IGS) has recently accepted for official release a new ionospheric product to characterize ionospheric irregularity and intensity as derived from multi-site ground-based GPS observations. This product was developed and implemented in the Space Radio-Diagnostic Research Center (SRRC), University of Warmia and Mazury. The product represents changes in the GPS-based Rate of TEC Index (ROTI) and has a polar projection within a range of 50°–90°N in geomagnetic latitude and 00–24 magnetic local time.

In this paper, the daily prediction of ROTI cards is implemented using machine learning methods.
